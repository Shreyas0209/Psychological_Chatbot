# Psychological_Chatbot

Mano - The AI Psychological Therapist
Mano is a web-based, AI-powered chatbot designed to provide a safe, empathetic, and non-judgmental space for users to explore their thoughts and feelings. It leverages the power of a large language model (Google Gemini) to engage in caring and supportive conversations, guided by principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).

‚ú® Features
Empathetic & Caring Persona: The chatbot is instructed by a detailed system prompt to always be supportive, kind, and understanding.

AI-Powered Conversations: Utilizes the Google Gemini API for intelligent, nuanced, and human-like conversational abilities.

Calming User Interface: A warm, clean, and inviting UI designed with a light orange color palette to create a sense of comfort and trust.

Therapeutic Guidance: Can offer well-known, safe coping techniques (like guided breathing) and gently guide users to reframe their thoughts.

Built-in Ethical Guardrails: Includes a clear disclaimer that it is not a substitute for professional therapy and provides a crisis warning.

Web-Based & Accessible: Built with Flask, making it easily accessible from any modern web browser.
